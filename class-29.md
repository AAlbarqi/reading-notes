# DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

### Silicon Valley’s gender gap

Silicon Valley’s gender gap, the obvious reasons are: 

1. the close relationship between computing and gaming in the 1980s.
2. Many of these companies blame the pipeline, citing poor enrollment and graduation rates among women in technology. 
3. The bias toward boys in advertising.
4. 20% of men plan to take on a career in engineering or computing. Among women, that number is just 5.8%. Women start out so far behind that they often can’t catch up.
5. The research revealed that women often feel isolated due to a lack of female role models and the sense of being excluded from “buddy networks” among men.
