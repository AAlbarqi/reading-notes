# Linked Lists

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.

## Linked Lists Types:

1. Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

2. Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

3. Circular

## Big O

- The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

- The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.
