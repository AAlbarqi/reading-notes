# Stacks and Queues

## Queue 
A queue works like a line for an amusement park ride -- people enter at the end of the queue and leave from the front (FIFO: first in, first out).

**Operations:**

- Enqueue O(1)
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

- Dequeue O(1)
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

## Stack 

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

A stack works like a stack of plates -- plates are added and removed from the the top of the stack (LIFO: last in, first out).

- Push O(1)
Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

- Pop O(1)
Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.
