# Access Control (ACL)

- Role-based access control (RBAC), or role-based security[3] is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.

- RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL
There are some alternatives for/variations of RBAC, including:

    - Access control lists (ACL) — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

    - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) — ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.

- Simplified five-step approach to getting RBAC it implemented:
    1. Inventory your systems
    2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
    3. Assign people to roles
    4. Never make one-off changes
    5. Audit

- encryption : the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. 

- token : an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.

- bearer : the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0, an opaque string, not intended to have any meaning to clients using it.

- secret : digital authentication credentials (secrets).

- JSON Web Token : an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
