### How to Solve Programming Problems:
- common mistake : the improper allocation of time, take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it => “measure twice and cut once,”.
*Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.*

- A simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

- *“Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” -Grant Cardone*
- It takes discipline to not become “busy.”, Jeff Goins once said: “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”
- “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet


### How to think like a programmer

- Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank
- “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

1. Understand.
2. Plan.
3. Divide
4. Stuck? (Debug,Reassess).
5. Practice.

### The 5 Whys
The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

**Note:** The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

#### How to Use the 5 Whys
1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
