# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
# Process & Design

- The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

- the designer needs to organize and prioritize the information to
communicate their message and help users find what they're looking for.

**Prioritizing** : By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from) those items.

**Organizing** : Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand). 

**Visual hierarchy** :
 refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. 
that includs : Size, Color, Style

**grouping and Similarity** :
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups, that includs: Proximity, Colsure, Continuance, White Space, color, Borders

# Designing Navigation:
Good navigation tends to follow these principles...
- Concise
- Clear
- Selective
- Context
- Interactive
- Consistent

**Wireframe** : A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

# Structure :

- HTML pages are text documents.
- X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- X Tags are often referred to as elements.
- X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- X Attributes require a name and a value.
- X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# HTML5 Layout

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

- X The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements).

- X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

- X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# EXTRA MARKUP

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

- X You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.

- X The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

- X The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

- X `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

- X The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

- X Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

# The ABC of Programming

## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER

- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser 

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP 

- **Vocabulary** : The words that computers understand
- **Syntax** : How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

## DEBUGGING
several ways to discover what might have gone wrong 

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking, there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

## HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER 

CONTENT LAYER
. html files 
PRESENTATION LAYER
. css files 
BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files 
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement. 

- CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT
- LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE 
- WRITE YOUR CODE
- SEE THE RESULTS

**A script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
- Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

- You should write comments to explain what your code does.
