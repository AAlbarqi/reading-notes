# Advanced React Native

what goes into a React Native app. There are two things:
- The native code
- The JavaScript code

 - What React Native does is take your JavaScript and use that logic to interact with the native code. In short: React Native exposes many native APIs to us.

 - When building a cross-platform app, you'll want to re-use as much code as possible. Scenarios may arise where it makes sense for the code to be different.

 React Native provides two ways to organize your code and separate it by platform:
- Using the Platform module.
- Using platform-specific file extensions.

- the Platform module can also be used to detect the version of the Android Platform in which the app is running.
